# Vision Transformer from Scratch using PyTorch

This repository contains a tutorial on how to build a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch using PyTorch. Vision Transformers have gained popularity in image classification tasks by leveraging Transformer architecture, which was initially designed for natural language processing.

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will build a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch using PyTorch. We will cover key concepts like image patching, positional embeddings, attention heads, and multi-head attention. By following this step-by-step guide, youâ€™ll learn how to implement each component and understand the inner workings of the Vision Transformer.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
